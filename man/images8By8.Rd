\format{Data frame with 90 rows and 67 variables:
\itemize{
  \item{direction direction of diagonal, factor "up", "down", "both"}
  \item{dimX dimension x of image, in pixels}
  \item{dimY dimension y of image, in pixels}
  \item{pixel1:pixel64 pixel of image, in number}

\description{
Dataset containing samples of multivariate normal distributions. 
Each row in the dataset represents a generated matrix. Dimensions are stored in
dimX and dimY columns. Directions "up" and "down" correspond to different 
covariance matrices. Direction "both" was created as a combination of "up" and "down".
